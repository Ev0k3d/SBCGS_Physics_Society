Had our first Physics Society session on Thursday 16th October!

As president, I had the pleasure of leading a thought experiment with our first members:

"What would happen to Earth if we magically turned off gravity and friction for 60 seconds."

The discussion escalated from floating oceans to planetary chaos - and ultimately global annihilation!

It was a brilliant start to the society: curiosity, collaboration, and a reminder of how even the simplest “what if” can unravel interesting physics.

Excited to see whats next...
