Physics Society - Week 2:

Today we journeyed into the quantum realm — exploring one of the most revolutionary turning points in modern physics: the Ultraviolet Catastrophe.

At the heart of our discussion was Max Planck’s daring breakthrough — the introduction of Planck’s constant, a bold mathematical idea that completely challenged classical physics.

In a moment of genius and "desperation", Planck proposed that energy isn’t continuous but comes in discrete “packets” — quanta. This radical idea not only resolved the ultraviolet catastrophe but laid the groundwork for quantum theory itself.

Just five years later, Albert Einstein built on Planck’s insight to explain the photoelectric effect — showing that light can eject electrons in quantised bursts of energy.

It was a challenging yet thought-provoking session to present, guiding the society through how one bold idea reshaped our understanding of the physical world.

After the half-term break, I’m hoping to start live demonstrations e.g double slit experiment — an exciting next step toward bringing physics to life in the room.

Can't wait to see what the future holds!
