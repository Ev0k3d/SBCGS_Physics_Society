Christmas at the physics society!

At this weeks physics society session, we thew ourselves into problems solving with a Christmas twist - where we had 30min to solve as many problem as possible.

We were allowed to do research about the questions within this time, but not use AI.

At the end - we managed to solve many problems including:

- how much fuel Santa would need for an entire trip around the world with no stops (hint: it was A LOT)
- How sound waves from Christmas carollers interact
- If Santa travelled 99% the speed of light to deliver the presents, every 1 hour for him would become about 7 hours for the rest of the world - sometimes you have to go slower to go faster 😂

A very intense and fun session of problem solving! 

Merry Christmas from the SBCGS Physics society!

Can’t wait to come back in the new year
