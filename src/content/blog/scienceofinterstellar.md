When the fate of humanity rests in the stars…


Today’s Physics Society session explored the science of Interstellar, where we stepped into the shoes of Cooper, Brand, Romilly and Doyle to break down the physics of black holes and the one-way nightmare of time dilation; all while on a mission to find a new home for humanity and grapple with the challenge of quantum gravity.

Einstein taught us that space and time form a unified fabric. When stars and planets exist within this fabric, their mass warps space-time around them.
The larger the mass, the more extreme the curvature, therefore the slower time passes relative to regions with weaker gravity.

Black holes — with incredibly dense mass concentrated into a tiny region — create such extreme curvature that beyond the event horizon, not even light can escape.

Gargantua (the black hole in the film) demonstrated this power dramatically: when the crew landed on Miller’s water planet, they lost 23 years of Earth time, despite experiencing only about 3 hours on the surface. 

After a near-fatal encounter with Dr. Mann — who deviously faked data about his planet — the crew found themselves hurtling toward Gargantua.

I used this moment to explain a real problem in modern physics: quantum gravity.

Physics currently relies on two extraordinarily successful yet incompatible frameworks: quantum mechanics, governing the smallest scales, and general relativity, which governs gravity and large-scale structure. We are still looking for a unified theory of quantum gravity that would reconcile these into one coherent description of nature.

In the film, this is why TARS and Cooper decide to fall into the black hole as Romilly suggested because collecting quantum data from the singularity might allow Murph (on earth) to derive a unified gravitational theory.

In the movie’s universe, Murph’s breakthrough finally allows humanity to leave Earth and journey toward a new home among the stars.

Black-hole slingshots, wormholes, and fifth-dimensional encounters may seem far-fetched now but who knows? Maybe it’s only a matter of time before, instead of us calling out to the stars, the stars call out to us.

It’s exciting to see the Physics Society continuing to tackle bigger scientific ideas each week! I can't wait to see where we go next!
