What does it take to be a Cambridge Engineer?


Rohan's answer?

Passion.

A lot of passion.

This week, we were incredibly privileged at the Physics Society to host a guest speaker event with Rohan Daggar

Rohan — a former St Bernard’s student — shared his journey from secondary school to working in a research position at the University of Cambridge, where he’s working on ground breaking wireless optical systems.

What stood out to me most was his humility; despite achieving so much, Rohan shared that he never saw himself as “the smartest,” but as someone who loved maths, physics and problem solving.

And it really made me think.

It’s so easy after bad exam results, constant rejection, or just sheer bad luck, to say:

“I’m not smart enough.”
“I’m just not cut out for it…”

But instead of accepting that, Rohan encouraged us to keep cultivating passion — whether that’s joining hackathons, starting a side project or even writing ;)

Einstein famously said:

“It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with the problems longer.”

Rohan’s talk was the perfect embodiment of this mindset.

A huge thank you to Rohan Daggar for taking the time to visit; it was a pleasure giving you a trip down memory lane, reuniting with the teachers and snapping photos with the students!

Huge thanks to St Bernard's Catholic Grammar School for allowing this event to go forward with a special thanks to Mr Watson for helping me arrange this

Can't wait to see what else the future holds 🚀
