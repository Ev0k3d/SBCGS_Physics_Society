What if time went… backwards? Don’t try to understand it — feel it.

This week at the Physics Society, we explored the mind-bending idea of time inversion, inspired by the sci-fi thriller TENET.

In forward time, we perceive cause and effect:
 Dropping a ball causes it to hit the ground.
 Pressing a piano key causes a sound.

But what if we could step through one of TENET’s “turnstile” machines and move backwards through time?

 What could possibly go wrong?

Turns out, quite a lot:

 1. Since time is reversed, you’d see effect before cause. If you (inverted) saw a puddle splash before stepping in it and then avoided it — how did the puddle splash at all?

 2. If you inverted yourself to prevent a disaster, and succeeded — why would you have inverted yourself in the first place? (The grandfather paradox)

 3. If you fired an inverted bullet into a wall, then from the forward perspective, that bullet hole must have always existed. But what if someone patched it up? Would your shot — or even you — still exist?

It was a fascinating discussion, which I illustrated using Tenet’s iconic red and blue timeline visuals.

 No wonder so many people left the cinema completely baffled.

Personally, thinking from the object’s perspective helped me understand inversion better. For example, when the bullet appears to “fly” back into the protagonist’s hand, it’s because — from the bullet’s point of view — it starts in his hand and ends on the table. We just see it in reverse.

I had so much fun discussing this with everyone — can’t wait to see what’s next!
