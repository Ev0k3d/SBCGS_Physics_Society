The Physics Society is back.


Today we explored why calculus didn’t just “help” classical mechanics, it made it precise.

1. Differentiation — turning motion into something measurable:

For a model like s = 16t², average speed over an interval is simple but the real question is:

What is the speed at one instant?

That’s where the derivative comes in. 

By shrinking the time step from Δt to an infinitesimal dt, we move from “two-point gradients” to an exact rate of change as dt approaches 0:
From points (t, s) and (t + dt, s + ds), the derivative ds/dt captures the instantaneous gradient — and therefore instantaneous velocity.

2. Integration — from sums to continuous physics:

Then we flipped the problem: instead of extracting a local rate, we built a whole quantity from tiny parts.

To do this I posed the question: “ Is it easier to flick your pencil from the end, or from the middle?” 

We used moments of inertia to figure this out, by modelled a pencil as a uniform 1D rod. The idea begins as a discrete sum:
I = Σ m r²

But real objects aren’t made of a few chunks: classical physics states they are continuous. So we let mass become dm, and the sum becomes an integral:
I = ∫ r² dm
 (or, using density, I = ∫ ρ r² dr)

And the result matched intuition: mass farther from the axis “counts more”, so it’s harder to flick from the end than the middle.

A satisfying session where graphs became objects — and maths became physics.
