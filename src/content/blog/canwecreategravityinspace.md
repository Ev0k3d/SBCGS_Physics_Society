Can we create gravity in space?



Short answer: No.

Long answer? Well… sort of

In this week’s Physics Society session, we switched gears and explored the classical mechanics behind centripetal force and angular velocity — inspired by the Space Station V from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.

Life in zero gravity might seem fun, floating and flying around; but the lack of gravity actually causes muscle atrophy and reduced bone density.

Astronauts currently exercise for around 2 hours a day to counter this — but what if they didn’t have to?

Enter Wernher von Braun’s centrifugal space station.

When an object is swung in a circle around a fixed point (as demonstrated with the yo-yo), it experiences an inward pull called centripetal force. 

This force constantly draws the object toward the centre of its circular path, allowing it to curve instead of flying off in a straight line.

That same inward force doesn’t just keep the yo-yo moving — it would act on everything inside a rotating station too.

Kubrick showed that by spinning a circular spacecraft about its centre, you can simulate gravity through centripetal acceleration.

A fun session exploring how radius and angular velocity influence the centripetal force and just how close we are to "making" gravity in space.

Can’t wait to see what’s next!
