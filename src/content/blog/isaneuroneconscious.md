Is a single neurone conscious? If not, how does putting billions of non-conscious neurones together produce a conscious being?


These were some of the questions we explored in our latest Physics Society session, where we discussed the nature of consciousness — blending biology, psychology, and plenty of physics.

I was joined by fellow consciousness enthusiast Isabel Estibeiro and together, we took different sides regarding two central questions:

1. Is consciousness a classical system or a quantum system?

The classical view, which Isabel mentioned is supported by mainstream neuroscience, suggests that the brain operates in a broadly similar way to engineered computers — with neurones acting like biological switches — suggesting that consciousness does not require quantum mechanics to function.

However, I showed that physicist Roger Penrose argued otherwise. 

Drawing on Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem, which shows that not all mathematical truths can be derived from formal rules, Penrose suggested that human understanding is non-computational — therefore cannot be fully explained by classical algorithms alone.

He proposed that consciousness must involve something beyond classical computation, potentially rooted in quantum physics. 

This idea was later developed with anaesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, who suggested that such quantum processes could occur within microtubules inside neurones, forming the Orch-OR (Orchestrated Objective Reduction) theory of consciousness.

2. Does consciousness exist only in the brain or somewhere else?

It is no surprise that mainstream science maintains that consciousness occurs in the brain given its strong links to neurotransmitter balance, neural activity and brain states.

But this raises a deeper question:

 How do non-conscious neurones give rise to conscious experience at all?

Federico Faggin offers a radically different perspective. 

Like Penrose, he agrees that consciousness is non-computable, but he does not suggest it arises from specific quantum events IN the brain. 

Instead, Faggin proposes that consciousness and free will are fundamental aspects of reality (postulates) rather than emergent properties of neural activity.

In this view, the brain does not create consciousness, but acts as an interface through which consciousness experiences interact with the physical world.

I like to think of it using a simple analogy:

Just because a radio can play music, it doesn’t mean the source of the music is in the battery or circuitry.

I explore these ideas in more depth in my article for the upcoming first edition of the SBCGS Science Magazine, releasing next week.

Huge thanks to Isabel for the brilliant discussion, Mr Brophy for arranging the room, and Anson for taking the photos — a genuinely fascinating session to run.
